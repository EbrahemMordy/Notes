### Selection

### Union
output tuples that appear in one or both of the input relations
- inputs must have same attributes
- duplicates are removed 
### Intersection
output tuples that appear in both of the input relations
- inputs must have same attributes
- duplicates are removed 
### Difference
output tuples that appear in the first relation of the input relations and don't appear in the second
### Product | Cross Product
output all possible combinations of tuples from input relations
### Join 'inner join'
output combinations of tuples from input with matching attribute value
### Tree Representation
represent the query as tree
